        <p>I've always liked being creative in regards with everything DIY and having been interested in Web Development for a while,<br></br>
        I took the leap of faith in 2021 when my partner (a Software Developer) got me intrigued in coding.<br></br>
        <img className="logoImage" src={require("../images/annika.jpg")} alt='Annika'/> The endless possibilities sparked my interest and I signed up to become one myself. <br></br>I am keen on working with React and Javascript,
            It's amazing to see the changes instantly FrontEnd, and being able to create literally everything.<br></br>
            I was born in Germany and lived in the beautiful Black Forest region, which (prepare yourself for a fun fact!) known for the biggest cuckoo clock
            in the world and of course : for the Black Forest Gateau. I have worked in different roles within the German / Swiss Health sector</p>
