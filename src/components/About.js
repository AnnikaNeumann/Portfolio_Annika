        <p><h3>Get to know me</h3>I've always liked being creative in regards with DIY & Web Development for a while,
        and I took the leap of faith in 2021 when my partner (a Software Developer) got me intrigued in coding.
        The endless possibilities  and instant visual changes Frontend sparked my interest and I signed up to become one myself.<br></br><br></br>I am keen on working with React/Javascript,
        to being able to create literally everything. I've been attending CodeClan's Professional 
        Software Development Course since February 2021 and I am excited to stepping into the tech industry.<br></br><br></br>
        I was born in Germany and lived in the beautiful Black Forest region, which (prepare yourself for a fun fact!) is known for the <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/worlds-largest-cuckoo-clock">World's largest Cuckoo Clock</a> 
        in the world and of course the Black Forest Gateau. <br></br><br></br> For the past 20 years I have worked in different roles within the health sector in Germany, 
        and Switzerland which I've enjoyed very much and where I've developed personally and professionally. <br></br><br></br>
        However, I always knew that I wanted to live in other places and so Ireland became my home 2006-2007. 
        I got interested in Scotland and it wasn't until 2009, that I'd spend my first holidays there and  
        move over with my beloved cats in 2016. Ever sine I had worked for the NHS Lothian in administrative roles which I believe prepared me with
        great interpersonal skills and being able to work with deadlines and how to approach problem solving for my future career as a Software Developer. <br></br>
        <h4>What I enjoy beside coding</h4>Riding my Vespa motorscooter, practising my British Sign Language Skills (Level 2), attending Star Trek/ Comic Conventions, Film Festivals,
        spending time in nature, fostering rescue cats in need of a new furrever home.</p>
