        <h3>Get to know me</h3>
       
        <p>I was born in Germany and lived in the beautiful Black Forest region, until I moved to Scotland 2016, where I worked for the NHS until February 2022 in administrative <t></t>roles.
        <br></br>However, I've always liked being creative and I was involved with Web Development in my previous job, 
        and I took the leap of faith in 2021 when my friend <br></br>(a Software Developer) got me intrigued with coding.<br></br>
        <br></br> A couple of years ago, I became interested in technology due to my amputation and the need to use an electronic knee joint,
        which works with a microprocessor. Knowing that someone wrote the software controlling my leg gave me an incredible sense of wonder. 
        The endless possibilities and instant visual changes sparked my interest in frontend development, 
        and I joined CodeClan to become a Developer myself.<br></br><br></br>The topic of accessibility is close to my heart and I would love 
        to be involved with a team who creates accessible web content for people in need.<br></br>Since August 2022 I have been working
        as a Junior Talend Engineer for Computershare in Edinburgh where I mainly work with Sql and Oracle Databases in combination with the ETL Tool Talend to support the team solving tickets.</p>
        
        <h3>What I enjoy in my offline time</h3>
        <p>Riding my Vespa, practising my British Sign Language Skills (Level 2), reading about forensic patholgoy, attending Star Trek/ Comic Conventions, Film Festivals, 
        spending time in nature <br></br>and fostering rescue cats in need of a new furrever home. Because I am not using actual programming languages in my daily workload <n></n>
        I'm always aiming to keep my JavaScript/React knowledge<br></br>up to date with little side projects and looking into courses online</p>
