        <p><h3>Get to know me</h3>I've always liked being creative in regards with everything DIY and having been interested in Web Development for a while,<br></br>
        I took the leap of faith in 2021 when my partner (a Software Developer) got me intrigued in coding.
        The endless possibilities sparked my interest and I signed up to become one myself. <br></br>I am keen on working with React and Javascript,
            cause I find it amazing to see the visual changes instantly FrontEnd, and being able to create literally everything. I've been attending CodeClan's Professional Software Development Course since February 2021 and I am keen on
            stepping into the amazing tech industry and developing my skills further.
            <h3>The Past</h3>I was born in Germany and lived in the beautiful Black Forest region, which (prepare yourself for a fun fact!) is known for the <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/worlds-largest-cuckoo-clock">World's largest Cuckoo Clock</a> 
             in the world and of course the Black Forest Gateau. <br></br><br></br> For the past 20 years I have worked in different roles within the German / Swiss Health sector which I've enjoyed very much and where I've developed personally and professionally. However, I always knew that I wanted to live in other places, too
             and so Ireland became my home 2006-2007. That actually got me interested in Scotland and Northern Countries in general. It was not until 2009, that I should visit Scotland for the first time and move over with my cats to Edinburgh in 2016 eventually. Here I had worked for the NHS Lothian in administrative roles <br></br> <br></br><h3>Today</h3>I believe that my coding knowledge and skills, compared with will bring valuable skills to your company
