        <h1>Loving life between Coding (since 2021) and Cats (for 38 years)</h1>
        <p>I've always liked being creative and everything DIY, I've been also been interested in Web Development for a while<br>
            I took the leap of faith in 2021 when my partner (a Software Developer) got me intrigued in coding.</br>
            That sparked my interest and I signed up to become one myself. I am keen on working with React and Javascript, <b>
            where I can see the changes instantly FrontEnd, and being able to create literally everything.
            </b>
            I was born in Germany and lived in the beautiful Black Forest region, which (prepare yourself for a fun fact!) known for the biggest cuckoo clock
            in the world and of course : for the Black Forest Gateau.  </p>
